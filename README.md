### Title: *Responses of coral gastrovascular cavity pH during light and dark incubations to reduced seawater pH suggest species-specific responses to the effects of ocean acidification on calcification*

**Authors:** Colleen B. Bove, Robert F. Whitehead & Alina M. Szmant

**Abstract:** Coral polyps have a fluid-filled internal compartment, the gastrovascular cavity (GVC). Respiration and photosynthesis cause large daily excursions in GVC oxygen concentration (O<sub>2</sub>) and pH, but few studies have examined how this correlates with calcification rates. We hypothesized that GVC chemistry can mediate and ameliorate the effects of decreasing seawater pH (pH<sub>SW</sub>) on coral calcification. Microelectrodes were used to monitor O<sub>2</sub> and pH within the GVC of *Montastraea cavernosa* and *Duncanopsammia axifuga* (pH only) in both the light and the dark, and three pH<sub>SW</sub> levels (8.2, 7.9, and 7.6). At pH<sub>SW</sub> 8.2, GVC O<sub>2</sub> ranged from ca. 0 to over 400% saturation in the dark and light, respectively, with transitions from low to high (and vice versa) within minutes of turning the light on or off. For all three pH<sub>SW</sub> treatments and both species, pH<sub>GVC</sub> was always significantly above and below pH<sub>SW</sub> in the light and dark, respectively. For *M. cavernosa* in the light, pH<sub>GVC</sub> reached levels of pH 8.4–8.7 with no difference among pH<sub>SW</sub> treatments tested; in the dark, <sub>GVC</sub> dropped below pH<sub>SW</sub> and even below pH 7.0 in some trials at pH<sub>SW</sub> 7.6. For *D. axifuga* in both the light and the dark, pH<sub>GVC</sub> decreased linearly as pH<sub>SW</sub> decreased. Calcification rates were measured in the light concurrent with measurements of GVC O<sub>2</sub> and pH<sub>GVC</sub>. For both species, calcification rates were similar at pH<sub>SW</sub> 8.2 and 7.9 but were significantly lower at pH<sub>SW</sub> 7.6. Thus, for both species, calcification was protected from seawater acidification by intrinsic coral physiology at pH<sub>SW</sub> 7.9 but not 7.6. Calcification was not correlated with pH<sub>GVC</sub> for *M. cavernosa* but was for *D. axifuga*. These results highlight the diverse responses of corals to changes in pH<sub>SW</sub>, their varying abilities to control pH<sub>GVC</sub>, and consequently their susceptibility to ocean acidification.
